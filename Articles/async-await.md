#async-await in¬†swift

**Disclaimer**‚Ää-‚ÄäThis is less of an article and more of a note that I have created after reading "async-await" articles and watching [Meet async-await in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10132/) WWDC-21 video.

Hopefully this will clarify some of the doubts that you have regarding "async-await in Swift". So, let's get straight into the topic.

*Note‚Ää-‚ÄäI am planning to write more on this topic and this article will be update accordingly in the future.*

## Synchronous function
A synchronous function is one that executes all its work in a simple, straight line on a single thread.

### Problem
-    Synchronous function calls are blocking calls.


## Asynchronous functions

### Types
- Asynchronous functions with completion handlers
- Asynchronous functions with delegation call-backs e.g. Location APIs delegates
- Asynchronous functions marked with async keyword ‚Äì New in Swift 5.5

asynchronous function with async keyword
`func fetchImage(for id: String) async -> UIImage`


## Asynchronous functions with completion handlers

### Problem - Swift can‚Äôt check our work
-    Can‚Äôt enforce invocation of completion handlers for all possible cases.
-    Can‚Äôt use swift‚Äôs usual error handling mechanism.

### Syntax - Things to notice
-    When you mark a function as async, the keyword should go just before ‚Äúthrows‚Äù in the function signature, i.e. just before the arrow if the function doesn‚Äôt throw.
-    ‚Äútry‚Äù is here because the data method is marked ‚Äúthrows‚Äù. 
-    Just as try is needed to call a function marked as throws, await is need to call a function marked as async.


## What async keyword indicates?
-    A function marked async is allowed to be suspended and when it suspends itself then it suspends its callers too, so callers must be async too.


## What await keyword indicates?
-    Await keyword is used to point out where in an async function it might suspend.


## Throwing function analogy 
-    While an async function may suspend, just because it marked as async doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will suspend, just like a function marked as throws doesn‚Äôt mean that it will always through an error, it may or may not throw.

-    Similarly, just because await is mentioned doesn‚Äôt mean function will definitely suspend there, just like using a ‚Äútry‚Äù keyword just before calling a function that can throw an error.

### Important points
‚ÅÉ    Async function can suspend as many times as it needs to
‚ÅÉ    While an async function may suspend, just because it marked as async doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will suspend. (Use throwing function analogy).
‚ÅÉ    Similarly, just because await is mentioned doesn‚Äôt mean function will definitely suspend there.
‚ÅÉ    But eventually whether an async function suspends or not, after finishing it will return the control of the thread to the calling function along with a value or error.
‚ÅÉ    A function may resume onto an entirely different thread.

### async properties and initialisers
‚ÅÉ    Not just functions but properties can be async too and so can initialisers.

### Things to notice
-    Only read-only properties can be async
-    Property getters can also throw

### Things to notice
-    If an expression has multiple async function calls, you only need to write await once, just like you only need one ‚Äútry‚Äù for an expression with multiple throwing calls.

## Completion handler version

### Declared under NSURLSession Category (Objective - c)

## async-await version

### Declared under URLSession extension

### Things to notice
-    In the async version, no need to add ‚Äúresume()‚Äù to invoke a data task.
-    async version returns non-optional data and response and in case of failure it throws an exception which makes it lot easier to handle at the call site as now there is no need to add extra logic to handle optional data or error.

### Things to notice
-    In the async version, no need to set an expectation for an asynchronous function.


# Xcode ‚Äì 13 Tip 
-    Xcode 13 has a new option to convert an asynchronous function with completion handler approach to an asynchronous function with async-await approach. 
-    CMD + left click on an asynchronous function with completion handler approach with present the conversion option.
